Rmd files for the project of the course Bayesian Networks of Radboud University, Nijmegen, NL.

**Attrition_BayesianNetworks.Rmd**: file used to construct Bayesian Network models in order to investigate causal relationships among economical and social variables related to the workers, to outline features and patterns which affect attrition practice.

**Attrition_StructureLearning.Rmd**: file were several *structure learning* algorithms - algorithms able to infer the structure of a graphical model uniquely from a set of data - are performed and compared.
